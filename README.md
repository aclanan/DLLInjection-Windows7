# DLLInjection-

This repo is for my DLL Injection Workshop for my Software Vulnerabilities class. Inside the repo you will find the injector code in C++ and the DLL files I used for my demo. The DLL files were generated using msfvenom and specific to Windows 7 and the payloads I used. In order to use them correctly you may want to recreate them and test them with the injector.
